## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
* When was the company incorporated?
* Who are the founders of the company?
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

A sad, but true reality is that everybody has to deal with health problems. It's 
become common practice for people when they first notice symptoms, to google them. 
Given that the typical person doesn't have any expertise in the field to know what 
questions to even ask, and the broad nature of Google's search algorithms, the 
results are almost definitely not displayed in a manner that a doctor would lay 
them out. Depending on what someone searches and the links they click on, the 
information they receive can vary drastically, but it's their best attempt at finding 
a quick answer, which is all they want. This leads many people to get uneccessarily 
alarmed and head to the doctors. Hospitals are constantly busy with patients, and 
people with serious conditions have to wait longer for urgent treatment, because of 
those who show up based on a distressful internet search. The opposite effect can 
happen for those who don't trust Google and choose to wait to see a doctor. If it's 
something urgent and they wait too long, there could be serious ramifications.  
That's where Andrew Le, M.D. got the idea for his company, Buoy Health. 

Andrew Le was a medical student at Harvard, and he witnessed a concerning number 
of patients coming into the ER after misinterpreting information they found online, 
and watched them make poor health decisions. At that same time, his father found 
out he had a mini stroke, months after it had happened. Andrew knew at that point 
he wanted to devote his time and energy towards finding a better way to utilize 
modern technology, and give people the right tools to check on their symptoms. 
Andrew Le finished his doctorate of medicine, and in 2014 he went on sabbitical, 
spending his time at Harvard Innovation Labs where he teamed up with three 
others, Adam Lathram (marketing & current President), Nate Ren (marketing), 
and Eddie Reyes (technical), and founded Buoy. The first funding they received was 
from an invester they met at a donor event after presenting their work, and it grew 
from there. Since then, they've raised ["over $67 million, with prominent healthcare investors 
including Optum, Cigna, Humana, WR Hambrecht + Co., and F-Prime."](https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/connection/from-point-a-to-point-unbelievable-how-buoy-health-scaled-from-idea-to-unbelievable-a-i-success-story/)


## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Misinformation and disinformation is more prevelant in today's day and age than 
ever before, and it really comes at a cost in the healthcare industry. When 
someone misdiagnoses themself, it can cost them time and money, seeing a doctor they 
shouldn't have seen. Medical staff and other sick patients are paying the price 
in that scenario as well. It could also cost people their own health and well-being
for not seeing a doctor they should have seen one. So having a quick and reliable way to 
get medical advice is priceless. That's what Buoy seeks out to deliver with it's 
A.I. assistant, 'Symptom Checker.' 'Symptom Checker' is a free to use, online A.I. 
chatbot, that listens and understands your concerns, identify's what's wrong, and 
forms a plan for you. It's built and designed by doctors and data scientists, and ...
